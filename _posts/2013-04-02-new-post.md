### My First App!

I decided to build App-a-Week in order to motivate myself and my friends to build and keep building.  I wanted to make a simple, collaborative blog that my classmates would be glad to use as a showcase for their work. I was tempted to build a Rails app, but [Carter](https://twitter.com/CarterRabasa) conviced me not to reinvent the wheel.

App-a-Week is built with jekyll-bootstrap and hosted on github pages.  Both of these tools are stunningly easy to use!  I found tons of great documentation for each, and got my site up and running in about a day. Check out my [github repo](https://github.com/leastridge) for all the details.
