Welcome to App-a-Week
=====================

App-a-Week is a blog devoted to showcasing ongoing projects.  Our collarorators are students and alumni of the CodeFellows program.  Check out our work!

What to Submit
--------------

App-a-Week is about progress not perfection. Submit whatever you've been working on.  If your project is online, please include a link.  If it only lives locally, take a screenshot.  Software projects of all flavors are welcome!

Submitting Content to App-a-Week
--------------------------------

App-a-Week is hosted by Github project pages, and it lives at [leastridge/app-a-week](http://github.com/leastridge/app-a-week).  If you would like to submit a post, please follow these steps

+ Fork the repo
+ Make sure you are working on the 'gh-pages' branch
+ In the terminal: `rake post title="Your Title"`.  This will create a new post in the _posts dir
+ Edit the post you created using markdown, add images, links to your github repo, whatever you like
+ Preview your changes to the site by running `jekyll --server` and checking out the site locally at localhost:4000
+ When you are satisfied, commit your changes and submit a pull request.  If you are already a collaborator, simply push to the `gh-pages` branch of this repo.
+ If you are a collaborator and you would like to edit anything other than your post, please email me first.

Style
-----
When you are writing your posts, please make your main post header h3 or smaller.  Our front page looks really strange otherwise.  Please also remember to sign your posts and link to your online presence however you see fit.
